## Identify Fishers

# Professional fisher:
#   P801. Which of the following best describes what %hmName% is MAINLY doing at present? == "Working in fishing or gleaning seafood"  (n = 46; all villages)
# 
# Casual fishers ('went fishing')
# P901. In the last 7 days, did %hmName% engage in fishing, hunting, or seafood collection? == YES (n = 1298)
# - Not worried about hunting; re: Jacob, people dont hunt on land.
# P902. In the last 7 days, how many hours did %hmName% spend in total on fishing, hunting, or seafood collection during the last week?
# 
# Fishing household: 
# - Contains professional fisher, OR
# - Contains casual fisher, OR
# - Consumed seafood from 'home production' in last 7 days
# - ADD? has any fishing hours? -  check if this is already in here.
# 
# H1503a. In the last 7 days, did any member of this household consume any of the following? (any yes = ate fish/inverts/shark- fresh, canned, preserved)
# H1503l. Was any of the %h1503b% %h1503c% of %rostertitle% consumed, came from HOME PRODUCTION?
